Open Source Tools description:

"The **Apache Hadoop** software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage."

"The **Hadoop Distributed File System** (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. HDFS is highly fault-tolerant and is designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware. HDFS provides high throughput access to application data and is suitable for applications that have large data sets."

"**Apache Kafka** is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications."

"**ZooKeeper** is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications."

"**Apache Hive** is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale. Hive Metastore(HMS) provides a central repository of metadata that can easily be analyzed to make informed, data driven decisions, and therefore it is a critical component of many data lake architectures."

"**Apache Sparkâ„¢** is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters."

"**Oozie** is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs."
