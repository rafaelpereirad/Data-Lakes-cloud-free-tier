## OCI Region – HA Building Blocks 

• Multiple fault de-correlated, completely independent datacenters: Availability Domain (AD)

• Grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an AD: Fault Domain

• Predictable low latency & high speed, encrypted interconnect between ADs

Inside an AD – High Scale, High Performance Network

• Non-oversubscribed network; no noisy-neighbors

• Very high scale – ~1 million network ports in an AD

• Predictable low latency & high speed interconnect between hosts in an AD

• Off Box Network Virtualization – moves storage and network IO out of the hypervisor and enables lower overhead and bare metal instances

• Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services
